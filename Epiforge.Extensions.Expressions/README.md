This library has useful tools for dealing with expressions:

* `ExpressionEqualityComparer` - Defines methods to support the comparison of expression trees for equality.
* `ExpressionExtensions`, providing:
  * `Duplicate` - Duplicates the specified expression tree.
  * `SubstituteMethods` - Recursively scans an expression tree to replace invocations of specific methods with replacement methods.

# Observable

This library accepts a `LambdaExpression` and arguments to pass to it, dissects the `LambdaExpression`'s body, and hooks into change notification events for properties (`INotifyPropertyChanged`), collections (`INotifyCollectionChanged`), and dictionaries (`Epiforge.Extensions.Collections.INotifyDictionaryChanged`).

```csharp
// Employee implements INotifyPropertyChanged
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth);
// expr subscribed to elizabeth's PropertyChanged
```

Then, as changes involving any elements of the expression occur, a chain of automatic re-evaluation will get kicked off, possibly causing the observable expression's `Evaluation` property to change.

```csharp
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth);
// expr.Evaluation.Result == 9
elizabeth.Name = "Lizzy";
// expr.Evaluation.Result == 5
```

Also, since exceptions may be encountered after an observable expression was created due to subsequent element changes, observable expressions include a `Fault` property in their evaluations, which will be set to the exception that was encountered during evaluation.

```csharp
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth);
// expr.Evaluation.Fault is null
elizabeth.Name = null;
// expr.Evaluation.Fault is NullReferenceException
```

Observable expressions raise property change events of their own, so listen for those (kinda the whole point)!

```csharp
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth);
expr.PropertyChanged += (sender, e) =>
{
    if (e.PropertyName == "Evaluation")
    {
        var (fault, result) = expr.Evaluation;
        if (fault is not null)
        {
            // Whoops
        }
        else
        {
            // Do something with result
        }
    }
};
```

When you dispose of your observable expression, it will disconnect from all the events.

```csharp
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
using (var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth))
{
    // expr subscribed to elizabeth's PropertyChanged
}
// expr unsubcribed from elizabeth's PropertyChanged
```

Observable expressions will also try to automatically dispose of disposable objects they create in the course of their evaluation when and where it makes sense. Use the `ExpressionObserverOptions` class for more direct control over this behavior.
You can use the `Optimizer` property to specify an optimization method to invoke automatically during the observable expression creation process.
We recommend Tuomas Hietanen's [Linq.Expression.Optimizer](https://thorium.github.io/Linq.Expression.Optimizer), the utilization of which would like like so:

```csharp
var options = new ExpressionObserverOptions { Optimizer = ExpressionOptimizer.tryVisit };

var a = Expression.Parameter(typeof(bool));
var b = Expression.Parameter(typeof(bool));

var lambda = Expression.Lambda<Func<bool, bool, bool>>
(
    Expression.AndAlso
    (
        Expression.Not(a),
        Expression.Not(b)
    ),
    a,
    b
); // lambda explicitly defined as (a, b) => !a && !b

var observer = new ExpressionObserver(options);
var expr = observer.Observe<bool>(lambda, false, false);
// optimizer has intervened and defined expr as (a, b) => !(a || b)
// (because Augustus De Morgan said they're essentially the same thing, but this involves less steps)
```
