This library has useful tools for dealing with expressions:

* `ExpressionEqualityComparer` - Defines methods to support the comparison of expression trees for equality.
* `ExpressionExtensions`, providing:
  * `Duplicate` - Duplicates the specified expression tree.
  * `SubstituteMethods` - Recursively scans an expression tree to replace invocations of specific methods with replacement methods.

# Observable
This library accepts a `LambdaExpression` and arguments to pass to it, dissects the `LambdaExpression`'s body, and hooks into change notification events for properties (`INotifyPropertyChanged`), collections (`INotifyCollectionChanged`), and dictionaries (`Epiforge.Extensions.Collections.INotifyDictionaryChanged`).

```csharp
// Employee implements INotifyPropertyChanged
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth);
// expr subscribed to elizabeth's PropertyChanged
```

Then, as changes involving any elements of the expression occur, a chain of automatic re-evaluation will get kicked off, possibly causing the observable expression's `Evaluation` property to change.

```csharp
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth);
// expr.Evaluation.Result == 9
elizabeth.Name = "Lizzy";
// expr.Evaluation.Result == 5
```

Also, since exceptions may be encountered after an observable expression was created due to subsequent element changes, observable expressions include a `Fault` property in their evaluations, which will be set to the exception that was encountered during evaluation.

```csharp
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth);
// expr.Evaluation.Fault is null
elizabeth.Name = null;
// expr.Evaluation.Fault is NullReferenceException
```

Observable expressions raise property change events of their own, so listen for those (kinda the whole point)!

```csharp
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth);
expr.PropertyChanged += (sender, e) =>
{
    if (e.PropertyName == "Evaluation")
    {
        var (fault, result) = expr.Evaluation;
        if (fault is not null)
        {
            // Whoops
        }
        else
        {
            // Do something with result
        }
    }
};
```

When you dispose of your observable expression, it will disconnect from all the events.

```csharp
var elizabeth = Employee.GetByName("Elizabeth");
var observer = new ExpressionObserver();
using (var expr = observer.Observe(e => e.Name.Length, elizabeth))
{
    // expr subscribed to elizabeth's PropertyChanged
}
// expr unsubcribed from elizabeth's PropertyChanged
```

Observable expressions will also try to automatically dispose of disposable objects they create in the course of their evaluation when and where it makes sense. Use the `ExpressionObserverOptions` class for more direct control over this behavior.
You can use the `Optimizer` property to specify an optimization method to invoke automatically during the observable expression creation process.
We recommend Tuomas Hietanen's [Linq.Expression.Optimizer](https://thorium.github.io/Linq.Expression.Optimizer), the utilization of which would like like so:

```csharp
var options = new ExpressionObserverOptions { Optimizer = ExpressionOptimizer.tryVisit };

var a = Expression.Parameter(typeof(bool));
var b = Expression.Parameter(typeof(bool));

var lambda = Expression.Lambda<Func<bool, bool, bool>>
(
    Expression.AndAlso
    (
        Expression.Not(a),
        Expression.Not(b)
    ),
    a,
    b
); // lambda explicitly defined as (a, b) => !a && !b

var observer = new ExpressionObserver(options);
var expr = observer.Observe<bool>(lambda, false, false);
// optimizer has intervened and defined expr as (a, b) => !(a || b)
// (because Augustus De Morgan said they're essentially the same thing, but this involves less steps)
```

# Observable Queries
This library provides re-implementations of LINQ operations, but instead of returning `Enumerable<T>`s and simple values, these return `IObservableCollectionQuery<T>`s, `IObservableDictionaryQuery<TKey, TValue>`s, and `IObservableScalarQuery<T>`s.
This is because, unlike traditional LINQ operations, these implementations continuously update their results until those results are disposed.

But... what could cause those updates?

* the source is enumerable, implements `INotifyCollectionChanged`, and raises a `CollectionChanged` event
* the source is a dictionary, implements `Epiforge.Extensions.Collections.INotifyDictionaryChanged<TKey, TValue>`, and raises a `DictionaryChanged` event
* the elements in the enumerable (or the values in the dictionary) implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` and raise a `PropertyChanged` event
* a reference enclosed by a selector or a predicate passed to the method implements `INotifyCollectionChanged`, `Cogs.Collections.INotifyDictionaryChanged<TKey, TValue>`, or `INotifyPropertyChanged` and raises one of their events

That last one might be a little surprising, but this is because all selectors and predicates passed to Observable Query methods become Observable Expressions (see above).
This means that you will not be able to pass one that an `ExpressionObserver` cannot observe (e.g. a lambda expression that can't be converted to an expression tree or that contains nodes that are unsupported).
But, in exchange for this, you get all kinds of notification plumbing that's just handled for you behind the scenes.

Suppose, for example, you're working on an app that displays a list of notes and you want the notes to be shown in descending order of when they were last edited.

```csharp
var notes = new ObservableCollection<Note>();
var collectionObserver = new CollectionObserver();

var observedNotes = collectionObserver.ObserveReadOnlyList(notes);
var orderedNotes = observedNotes.ObserveOrderBy(note => note.LastEdited, isDescending: true);
notesViewControl.ItemsSource = orderedNotes;
```

From then on, as you add `Note`s to the `notes` observable collection, the `IObservableCollectionQuery<Note>` named `orderedNotes` will be kept ordered so that `notesViewControl` displays them in the preferred order.

Since `IObservableCollectionQuery<T>`'s are automatically subscribing to events for you, you do need to call `Dispose` on them when you don't need them any more.

```csharp
void Page_Unload(object? sender, EventArgs e)
{
    orderedNotes.Dispose();
    observedNotes.Dispose();
}
```

Ahh, but what about exceptions?
Well, Observable Expressions contain a `Fault` element in their `Evaluation` properties, but... you don't really see those Observable Expressions as an Observable Query caller, do ya?
For that reason, Observable Queries all have `OperationFault` properties.
You may subscribe to their `PropertyChanging` and `PropertyChanged` events to be notified when an Observable Expression or the overall Observable Query runs into a problem.
If there is more than one fault in play, the value of `OperationFault` will be an `AggregateException`.

Since the `ExpressionObserver` has a number of options governing its behavior, you may optionally pass one you've made to the constructor of `CollectionObserver` to ensure those options are obeyed when Observable Expressions are created to enable your Observable Queries.
